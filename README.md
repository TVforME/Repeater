# Welcome to the DATV Repeater Project!

🚀 **Revolutionise digital amateur television!** 

The DATV Repeater project is at the forefront of software inovation, leveraging the advances in GPU hardware to deliver a software dirived DATV Repeater!

🌍 This project is not just about making the design configurable and extendable, its about connecting the ATV community across Australia. Inspired by the Voctomix project, the project takes a step further by integrating with Gstreamer's GPU decoding and encoding wrapped in

🛠️ My design was to avoid a typical DATV repeater consisting of stack of black-boxes interconnect with HDMI cables,  black-boxes made to talk with each using microcontrollers etc. My software approach has been a 4 year learning experience with the design to be used specifically for the Geelong Amateur Radio Club DATV repeater. The repeater site is located at Mount Anakie Victoria. Call sign **VK3RGL**
