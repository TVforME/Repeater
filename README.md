- 👀 I’m interested in Amateur Digital Television and the technology to produce DVB signals.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Go programming and have worked in Broadcast TV (CVBS before SDI).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others who are also Gophors and know the Gstreamer framework.

- ⚡ Did you know that H.264 is a cornerstone of modern broadcast TV, reducing bandwidth by over 50% compared to previous technologies? While H.266 offers even more compression, it's unlikely to hit free-to-air TV soon due to the high costs of implementation by broadcasters and TV manufacturers. Another nugget of advice:-  You know FTA TV is well on the ways to a death spirl? The quality of FTA content more ads louder and biased news? Most of us have taken up streaming services. Myself are fond of YouTube, there is always people doing something worth watching.
