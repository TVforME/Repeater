# Welcome to the DATV Repeater Project!

🚀 **Revolutionise digital amateur television!** The DATV Repeater project is at the forefront of software inovation, leveraging the advances in GPU hardware, GStreamer framework to deliver a software dirived DATV Repeater!

🌍 This project is not just about making the design configurable and extendable, its about connecting the ATV community across Australia. Inspired by the Voctomix project, the project takes a step further by integrating with Gstreamer's GPU decoding and encoding wrapped in Go ![Go-heart-balloon-32x40](https://go.dev/) 
for parallelism and speed.

🛠️ The DATV Repeater serves to move the typical reeater design away from the interconnection of black-boxes connected together with interface glue (microcontrollers etc) and cbales. The software approach is specifically for the Geelong Amateur Radio Club DATV repeater VK3RGL located at Mount Anakie Victoria.

💡 Dive into our documentation to learn more about how the DATV Repeater is setting new standards in the amateur television landscape.

🆘 If your into GStreamer and GO or bash install scripts and up to helping out, please drop me a an email and introduce yourself.

🔗 Stay tuned as we continue to develop and refine this project, and see how you can get involved in shaping the future of amateur digital television broadcasting!
