- ⚡ Did you know that H.264 is a cornerstone of modern broadcast TV, reducing bandwidth by over 50% compared to previous technologies? While H.266 offers even more compression, it's unlikely to hit free-to-air TV soon due to the high costs of implementation by broadcasters and TV manufacturers. Tech innovation at its best, but sometimes costs keep it just out of reach!
