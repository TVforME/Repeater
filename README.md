# Welcome to the DATV Repeater Project!

🚀 **Revolutionise digital amateur television!** 

The DATV Repeater project is at the forefront of software inovation, leveraging the advances in GPU hardware to deliver a software dirived DATV Repeater!

🌍 This project is not just about making the design configurable and extendable, its about connecting the ATV community across Australia. Inspired by the Voctomix project, the project takes a step further by integrating with Gstreamer's GPU decoding and encoding wrapped in Go [![Go-heart-balloon-32x40](https://github.com/TVforME/Repeater/assets/168706311/6d85af8a-82d8-49eb-ae11-fefb2bbc466b)](https://go.dev/ "Visit the GO website")
for parallelism and speed.

🛠️ My design was to avoid the typical repeater design consisting of interconnection of black-boxes interfaced with glue logoc (microcontrollers etc) to make it all work. My software approach has been 3 year learning experience specifically for the Geelong Amateur Radio Club to install a DATV repeater VK3RGL repeater site located at Mount Anakie Victoria.

🆘 If your into GStreamer and GO or bash install scripts and up to helping out, please drop me a an email and introduce yourself.

🔗 Stay tuned as we continue to develop and refine this project, and see how you can get involved in shaping the future of amateur digital television broadcasting!
