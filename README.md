# Welcome to the DATV Repeater Project!

üöÄ **Revolutionize digital amateur television!** 

The DATV Repeater project is at the forefront of software innovation, leveraging advances in GPU hardware to deliver a software-derived DATV Repeater!

## Repeater Overview

üåç This project is not just about making the design flexible and extendable; It was inspired from the [Voctomix](https://github.com/voc/voctomix) project, a is a video mixing software, written in python and the Gstreamer framework. I have adapted to take full advantage of using NVIDIA h246 for GPU decoding and encoding using [NVIDIA Tesla P4](https://images.nvidia.com/content/pdf/tesla/184457-Tesla-P4-Datasheet-NV-Final-Letter-Web.pdf) PCIe card/s.  

DATV repeater is coded in GO! to leverage concurrency and parallelism and speed. I orginally developed the functionallty in Python 3 however, soon relised limitations as my designed became more complex making for a decision to look for a programming lanuage change.  

Do I use [Rust](https://github.com/TVforME/Repeater/blob/main/assets/icons/rust.svg)<img src="[https://github.com/TVforME/Repeater/blob/main/assets/icons/rust.svg]" alt="Rust" width="100" height="100">   or migrate to C++ ?? or do I learn GO! 

Out of the 3, I found the balance with GO! 

## Let's GO!
- **GO is built for concurrency. Parallelism out-of-the-box:**  GO is design to run functions is parallel GO's way of threading using goroutines.
- **NO Object Orientated Programming:** I'm not a fan of OOP Classes and overrides all that jazz.  I've come from C pointers and structures, GO uses old school C structure, interfaces and can handle "strings" properly.
- **Easy to use and great support:** GO is a modern programming laugauge. it's easy and there is plenty of support of forums and Youtube how to's..
- **Compiles to ONE executable:**  That's right, ONE executable. No frameworks, or addition lanuage dependencies.  GStreamer and few other libraries are requires for repeater to operate however, this is a given regardless of language used.
- **Statically Typed lanuage:**  Hard to get it wrong.. GO's intuitive compiler lets you know before compilation your if your passing a function a int over a string. 

üõ†Ô∏è The design aims to reduce valuable rack space at a facility and use a more modern approach to AV mixing and playout in DVB tansport stream. A typical DATV repeater consists of black boxes interconnected with HDMI/USB/SDI cables, using IR or serial converters to communicate between these blackboxes with a microcontroller. My software approach has been a four-year learning experience, and ongoing addiction..
